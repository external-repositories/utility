 * Otherwise the *found* flag is set to true. If a string is extracted but isn't 
 * a boolean value, this method records an error via the logger specifying the 
 * variable name (see the *name* argument) and throws an exception.
 *
 * Although fortran has accepted boolean variable (called logical variables in 
 * fortran) as **t** / **f** (and variants thereof) for 25 years at the time of 
 * writing this, NJOY2012 still reads and stores boolean variables as integers, 
 * with 0 corresponding to false and 1 corresponding to true.
 *
 * NJOY21 will support reading boolean variables this way for backwards 
 * compatability reasons */
